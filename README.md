This is Hattie McGill
My Hello World GitHub Project will consist of all four components of a GitHub Account. These include Repositories, Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests.
I enjoy Computers! I think that they are Logical, Organized Brain Bits that form a Picture from Text, Graphs, and Numerical Representation. 
This is a first for me. 
I just want to see if I can do this before committing to something that I cannot do Well.
These Changes that I have made reflect Why I enjoy Computers, as I learn how to write "Commit Messages."
